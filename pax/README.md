# Syncing mods
To sync the mods with the ones that are writen in the manifest.json, run `sync_mods.bat`.

# Syncing overides
Everyting that is not writen in the manifest.json is an overide. (For example: configs, scrips, resources)
To copy the overides you changed to the pax/modpack/overides folder, run `sync_overrides.bat`.



# Pax usage
Use pax using command like or terminal.
