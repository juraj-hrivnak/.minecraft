Minecraft modpack template, that uses [Pax] and [ModPackDownloader] in order to function.


# Syncing mods
To sync the mods with the ones that are writen in the manifest.json, run `sync_mods.bat`.

# Syncing overides
Everyting that is not writen in the manifest.json is an overide. (For example: configs, scrips, resources)
To copy the overides you changed to the pax/modpack/overides folder, run `sync_overrides.bat`.



# Pax usage
Use pax using command line or terminal.
To see how [Pax] works it's recommended to checkout its wiki: [here](https://github.com/froehlichA/pax/wiki)

## Locating pax folder
Locate the pax folder in your computer.
On both Windows and Linux you can use `cd` to do that.

### Examples:
```cmd
Windows:
$ cd .\minecraft\pax

Linux:
$ cd ./minecraft/pax
```
