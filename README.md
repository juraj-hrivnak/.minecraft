# Modpack Template

An easy-to-use template for an automated modpack development environment.

## Features

- Manage mods without using the CurseForge launcher using [PAX].
- Automatically
  - export _modpack_ and _server pack_ and deploy to CurseForge and GitHub.
  - handle _changelogs_ easily, based on [Keep a Changelog].
  - handle development builds.
  - close issues with the _fixed in dev_ label on release.
